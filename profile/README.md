## About ArtRage Lite
ArtRage Lite is a streamlined digital painting application focused on delivering a genuine traditional art experience on a digital canvas. It captures the physical properties of real-world art materials, allowing artists, illustrators, and hobbyists to paint with oils that blend and smear, use watercolors that diffuse and bleed, or sketch with pencils that show grain and pressure sensitivity. This focus on natural media simulation makes it an ideal tool for those seeking an organic, tactile creative process without the setup or cleanup of a physical studio.

The application provides a carefully selected set of the most popular and practical tools from the full ArtRage suite. It balances simplicity with powerful features, making it accessible for beginners while remaining capable for everyday creative work. Artists can experiment with color mixing on a virtual palette, work with multiple layers for complex compositions, and import references to guide their painting. ArtRage Lite serves as a perfect entry point into digital natural media and a reliable, focused studio for creating textured, expressive artwork.
